    "text": "Listed investment company IP Group has blamed the crisis at Neil Woodford’s fund management business for recent poor performance.
    Shares in IP Group, which is listed on the FTSE 250, fell 9 per cent on Tuesday after it reported the value of its portfolio had shrunk by 3 per cent in six months.
    Mr Woodford is the second-biggest shareholder in IP Group and has close ties to several of the businesses it has launched, including Oxford Nanopore, the DNA sequencing company that makes up close to a quarter of IP Group’s portfolio.
    According to IP Group, Mr Woodford has holdings in 12 of its companies, making up more than a third of its portfolio by value. Other companies that both have backed include Inivata, Cell Medica, Mission Therapeutics and PsiOxus Therapeutics.
    Mr Woodford has been one of the biggest supporters of early-stage UK healthcare companies. IP Group said the closure of his flagship fund in June had led to a loss in confidence in healthcare start-ups.
    “Market sentiment towards the sector in which the group operates was impacted by the well-publicised difficulties experienced by Woodford Investment Management, one of the sector’s longest-standing supporters,” the company said in a statement.
    Alan Aubrey, chief executive, said: “The group has made good operational and strategic progress, notwithstanding the significant decline in the group’s share price during the period. In particular, as the portfolio matures our business is approaching self-sustainability.”
    IP Group’s share price has fallen 44 per cent since the start of the year.
    Mr Woodford declined to comment.
